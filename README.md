# asm
All my x86 Assembly Language Code
Feel free to reference my code if you are curious about assembly or just want a point of reference.
There are a lot of ways to accomplish what I did in whatever code you look at. These are just some of
the things I did to accomplish those goals in my way. I utilized Irvine's library significantly to simplify
the process as well. I typically comment heavily when I code so if you are a beginner, you should be able to
follow along with what is happening.
